**A Web Server built in python with concurrency in mind**

Welcome to my dynamic Python web server project! This server is designed to handle concurrent requests while delivering dynamic content using the power of Python's multi-threading and the CGI protocol.

From managing sockets to exploring the http protocol, this project has given me hands-on experience in networking, concurrency, and server-side scripting. 

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate if you have any suggestion or if you want to chat 

Last but not least these challenges are provides by the fabulous [John Crikett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett) through his newsletter.
